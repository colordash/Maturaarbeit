Please remember the issue tracker on github is {\itshape not} for user support. Please also do not email developers directly for support. Instead please use IRC or the forums first, then if the problem is confirmed create an issue that details how to repeat the problem so it can be investigated.

Issues created without steps to repeat are likely to be closed. E-\/mail requests for support will go un-\/answered; All support needs to be public so that other people can read the problems and solutions.

Remember that issues that are due to mis-\/configuration, wiring or failure to read documentation just takes time away from the developers and can often be solved without developer interaction by other users.

Please search for existing issues {\itshape before} creating new ones.\doxysection{Developers}\label{md__c_1_2_hier_2_m_a___drohne_2_drohne___project_2betaflight_2_c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md13}
